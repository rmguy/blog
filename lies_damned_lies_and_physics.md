Title: lies, damned lies and physics

## Two lies and a truth

* Bodies with mass attract each other
* Nothing can surpass the speed of light
* Everything that's not forbidden is compulsory 

<hr></hr>

The truth of the matter is this: we don't know yet whether anything can surpass the speed of light. We thought we did, till we observed `IceCube-170922A`.

## Caveat Emptor

Ok, ok, ok ..before I start talking about "Ice-Cubes", before you start listening, my conscience compels me to present you with a graph.

Make of that what you will. I'll never mention it again.
Now that _that's_ out of the way. 
`IceCube-170922A` is the technical name for a neutrino recorded by the IceCube observatory. It is thought to have come from a star some 300 billion light years away.

## Lie I: The speed of light is absolute

IceCube is a neutrino observatory. It records cosmic matter incident on its receptors and notifies physicists around the world. These physicists determine where the particles came from.

Say IceCube records a random neutrino: How do we know it's from a given star and not its neighbor? this way:    

* We know its neighbor is not decaying, i.e we can observe dying stars with a telescope, and only dying stars emit high energy neutrinos.
* Even if its neighbor were decaying, IceCube also records incident cosmic radiation. We can guess the compositions of stars based on the wavelengths they emit. So we can guess the source of the radiation that follows a neutrino. 

Say we see a neutrino now, we just wait till we see the ensuing radiation. If we see wavelength A we guess Alpha Centauri+1234, if we see wavelengths B and C, we guess Alpha Centauri+4567. Something like that. 

Here's what's special about `IceCube-170922A` though, based on the aforementioned process, it is thought to have arrived _10 days_ before electromagnetic waves matching the signature of the star. This means it must have been travelling at a velocity = (1 + 8.1 x 10^â€“12)c i.e **a velocity = _(number > 1) * c_**. 

Ain't that a bitch.

### General relativity

Einstein said ~~let there be light~~ `E=mc^2`.. and he was probably right. 
He also said nothing can travel faster than light. He could've been wrong. 
His reasoning was this: as you approach the speed of light, you begin to convert mass to energy. When you attain `c`, your mass is that of a photon so you're no longer yourself, you're weightless. 

Now lets say there was such a thing as "imaginary mass", i.e mass^2 < 0. This means you can exceed the speed of light. But what does imaginary, or for that matter even "negative" mass mean? It could be a calculation error. Or it could mean that your mass is only measurable in lower dimensions.

### Gargamel

So for the sake of argument, let's say neutrinos, those particles from the stars that arrived 11 days before photons from the same stars, have -ve mass. This means they really exist in a different dimension. They're 2d particles that have a footprint in 3d. Just ignore the unknowns for now, sorry, stay with me. 

Actually no. I can explain this.

How do we know neutrinos exist in the first place? Because of Gargamel. Gargamel was a 30 cubic meter tank of liquid Freon maintained just at it's vapor pressure. The Freon wanted to create bubbles, but it couldn't, because bubbles need to nucleate. And there was no charge available to facilitate that reaction. Magnets around the tank made sure of that.

Now smart physicists at CERN decided to fire protons at Gargamel. What this displayed is a stream of disturbing bubbles that could only be explained by the existence of neutrinos. That could only be explained by particles that have no mass in 3d. Particles capable of ejecting other charged particles from an _in-tact_ nucleus, which have enough charge to nucleate bubbles (NB: neutrinos have 0 charge). 

Ergo, neutrinos exist.
They could have -ve mass.
They might be capable of attaining speeds > c.

## Lie II: Gravity is always attractive

Know what I really don't like about the big bang theory? the fact that it's a bangless theory. It really doesn't tell us what banged, why it banged and what came before the bang. It also doesn't explain where star matter came from, but that's besides the point. 

A far more interesting theory is that of cosmic inflation. It postulates the existence of a tiny patch of material with negative mass and very strong negative gravitational forces capable of expanding an egg like droplet into the known universe. Two curious things about negative gravity though:

* The weak and strong interactive forces, and the positive gravitational forces only came into existence some 3x nanoseconds after the negative gravitational force. 
* The patch of negative mass decayed quickly enough for the other three interactive forces to hold the universe together. 

So at first we had some goo. From that came -ve mass and -ve gravity pushing the goo apart, creating weak and strong interactive forces and +ve gravity. Slowly the -ve mass decayed, and electrostatic forces catalysed chemical reactions that produced more molecules than were in the droplet. Elements were born. Hydrogen and Helium started to fuse and fiss forming stars. Around these stars other clumps of mass started to oscillate creating solar systems. At some point all the combustible matter in the star was exhausted, emitting -ve mass particles, photons and various other EM waves. A few billion years later, IceCube picked up on this conspiracy.

## 3 statements yet to be falsified 

* Bodies with _postive_ mass attract each other 
* We think we have evidence of bodies with -ve mass that exceed the speed of light
* Everything that's not forbidden is compulsory 

The proof of the third "truth" is left as an exercise for the reader. Or as an endeavor for another post. I could just say it's self evident, given that 2 fundamental laws of physics are at the brink of falsification, but that would be a cop-out.

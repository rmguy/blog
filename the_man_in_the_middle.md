Title: "The Man" In The Middle

Here is my attempt to clarify the social implications of what cryptographers refer to as a "Man In The Middle" attack.

Doctor Zhivago is a book about an orphan who becomes a Physician and forms complicated love triangles. While this book is long and confusing, mostly because the author keeps inventing new names for the characters, it is pacifist at its very heart. It was censored in the USSR because of its depiction of totalitarian tendencies inherent in the Russian revolution.

Harsh punishments were meted out to people found possessing a copy. Of course, now people had to get their hands on a copy, and so began the Samizdat dissident movement. Mainframe printing presses were commandeered at night, to print and distribute material censored by the state. Unbeknownst to the Russian intelligentsia, many such printers were under the control of the KGB's First Department, who cunningly dragged not the copiers or the writers, but the readers of Samizdat, off to Lubyanka.

I don't think distributing Samizdat is wrong. I don't think working for the KGB is wrong. Clearly, both can be wrong for the right reasons. I think there's something really wrong with distributing Samizdat *and* working for the KGB. Such a distributor is a man in the middle.

Technology has come far in the last 50 years, but humanity has not. There is still civil unrest. There is still oppression. Somewhere in Egypt, there are a band of refugees communicating through a database owned for profit, controlled by a guy in California who obeys disclosure orders from governments, and there's pretty much nothing an engineer can do about it. I view this as a crucial failing of the IT industry.

**Abstract**    
This paper uses data made available in the Septuagint, and powerful statistical methods, to evaluate the psychopathology of revenge seeking individuals.

**Literature Review**   
We have found very little by way of academic backing to support our theory. In other words, we are trailblazers. The only researcher who has come close to this scale of heresy is Carl Sagan. In Sagan's seminal novel "Contact", the main character, Ellie, questions authority figures as to who Cain's wife is. We have built on this line of reasoning by asking what became of Cain's kids. 

**Background**   
The bulk of our research is based on the Genesis, verses `4:17-24`, reproduced here for your kind perusal 
```console
And Cain had relations with his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. 
..
Now to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methusael, and Methusael was the father of Lamech.
..
Lamech said to his wives,
“Adah and Zillah, listen to me;
    wives of Lamech, hear my words.
I have killed a man for wounding me,
    a young man for injuring me.
If Cain is avenged seven times,
    then Lamech seventy-seven times.”
...
[Lamech’s other wife,] Zillah also bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. 
```

Based on our analysis of this holy scripture we propose the following hypothesis: _There is a link between the psychopathology of revenge seeking individuals and the proclivity to broad-scale warfare._

**Methodology**    
The technique - due to Singh (who himself is an infidel, but a promising statistician, as shown in: Singh, 1977, Applications of estimators of a density and its derivatives to certain statistical problems) - is briefly described here. 

Let Y be God's attitude, projected on a scale of of zero to one (i.e it takes the value of 1 if God has been exceptionally wrathful to the subject). Let X be the desire for revenge. The population density of X is then summarized by a univariate f(X), which has been approximated by Cain et.al (NIV Bible, Genesis 4:22, circa 1400 BC). For now we ask that you accept on faith that the conditional density of X given Y takes the form:

`g(X|Y) = a(Y)exp(XY)`

In English, this suggests that as God's (though it could certainly be an unobserved exogenous variable, like say, the United States') wrath increases, the population density of revenge seeking individuals goes up by an exponential factor.

**Proof**    
Here we provide a layman's, plain English proof of correctness:     

* Cain, kills Abel, with a rock or something (Genesis 4:1, NIV)
* Cain's kids, kill 7 times, presumably avenging him (Genesis 4:23, NIV)
* Cain's grand-kids, kill 77 times, for god knows what reason (Genesis 4:24, NIV)
* Tubalcain pops up on the horizon, several generations down from Cain, and he makes artifices of war (Genesis 4:22, NIV)

*QED*

**Conclusion**

The empirical conclusions from this analysis are important. 

* A little destruction by way of revenge, does no good, and may make things worse (i.e you probably go on to have a city of kids)
* Much destruction seems to help the soul

**Future Work**    
We suggest future research in the following areas:   

1. The location of Enoch, the first city, named after Cain's firstborn. According to the Biblical account, the city was built by Cain’s descendents in the Iraq/Syria/Jordan belt (i.e erstwhile Mesopotamia). 
2. Exogenous variables other than the wrath of God that could lead to revenge seeking behavior. 
3. The descendancy of Awan, sister of Cain. Though we have no idea what she looked like, they say she had kind eyes.

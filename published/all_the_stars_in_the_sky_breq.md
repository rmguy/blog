Avaya receives a suspicious email from a stalker who says he's going to sing for her at 8 pm. She ignores it and goes to the LIGO instead, where she encounters 2 mysteries: 1. surprisingly powerful gravitational wave readings on the Interferometer 2. the entire sky momentarily blanking out on the regular (i.e visible) spectrum. This happens at exactly 8 pm. Alarmed, she checks her email and finds a message from the stalker taking credit for both.

I sing the sky. 

I climb up onto the plinth at the intersection of the telescope's arms, and start ululating nonsense into the night. 

"AAAAAAA; GAAGAGGGAGGAGAR".

It comes out of my mouthpiece a throaty chirp. You'd know what that sounds like if you've ever heard a gravitational wave. 

On my home planet we don't listen to songs, songs listen to us. We use them to preserve our prisoners. 

No, not therapeutically, _literally_. 

Calculated decibel levels when aimed at the right angles to stellar trajectories, when converted to gravitational waves, can keep the erratic g-forces of a trinary star system from playing pool with the planets in between. 

Alpha Centauri is a triple star system. Rigil, Toiman and Centauri. They form a minacious love triangle with my planet, Proxima-A, at the center. Except the triangle is sometimes isosceles, sometimes scalene, and sometimes as perfectly symmetric as a flat line. Everything in-between used to get yanked around like a kite in a storm.

At first, we tried praying. 
Then we tried math. 
Finally everyone gave up and just migrated out of the destructive radius. Everyone, that is, except convicted prisoners from the other Three Colonies. These prisoners were shipped off to suffer a fate of their choosing on the rolling death cradle that was Proxima-A. 

Good seasons on Proxima were ones that didn't rain hellfire because the planet got too close to a star. Bad seasons coincided with extinction. Driven to desperation, a group of lifers started mining the massive stores of hematite seeping out of Proxima's super heated crust. It was thankless labor because merchants refused to land on the surface, but the miners re-buried it shallow, hiding out bad seasons in the depts of the mines.  

Then there was an unprecedented good season. Chaplains called it God's stimulus package. Proxima reached capacity, additional prisoners were sent to the moon and braver merchants started hauling the ore off planet. The prisoners formed a union to manage profits, with a lion's share allocated to gravitational wave research. The rest was split between "planet hunting" - finding habitable exoplanets outside the Three Colonies, and "revenge" - weaponizing Proxima to simply take over the Three Colonies.

None of that (other than the part about revenge being a dish best served burnt) is relevant. I'm telling you because you're listening. I love a captive listener. 

I don't even need precision to change the color of light, only proximity. And just a whisper would've done fine. A demure "aaaaaaaa; gaagagggaggagar", but there's too much ambient noise on this damn planet. There's a bevy of noisy mamoids guffawing somewhere. I consider edifying them on my canonical obligations: "_so I will silence the sound of your songs, and the sound of your harps will be heard no more_". I quite enjoy your holy books. Ours say things like: "_No physical harm shall come to something that's broken_". It's full of shit. It felt nice to scream in the open for a change.. maybe they'd feel the same way. 

Bethod's capacitor vibrates. I check the message knowing where it's from. I need to meet one of you, but you're still reluctant, and no one else has replied. 

_Fuck this_

I type, "I tried to warn you fifty years ago."

I'd considered the problem of First Contact long and hard. Figured it had to happen with several individuals, but not a group. Several _someones_ who could verify my claim. That left me in need of a physicist, a mathemagist, and a geologist. I knew it was a tall order, made taller still by my distance and unfamiliarity, but I eventually narrowed down on fifteen potentials. I divided them into groups based on location and devised a test of self-posession for each. If they panicked, they failed, and I would start over with the next group. But in none of these fantasies did I factor in my own lack of judgement. None of them had even replied. 

I should've gone after sociologists instead. The Scythes probably had. 

"This is not a threat. I don't need to write you a story to threaten you. It is a plea. A confession. And a maddening failure."

I climb down from the plinth and sit on a small hump of dead rubble, balancing the capacitor between my knees. While I wait for a reply, I treat myself to a bag of reserves I stole. Porridge, it seems. It tastes gorgeously grey and horrible. I say this as someone who enjoys slops in general.  

This place reeks of dead cows and bigotry. The capacitor says I'm in Aundha Nagnath, a hovel in a deeply religious place called India. I understand some of that. But I understand dead cows and bigotry better. Almost as well as I understand burnt lips and gravity.. though sometimes I choose to forget that my lips aren't burnt anymore.  

I hit send.

<button onclick="starsBreq2_spOneOnClick()" id="starsBreq2_spoilerButtonOne" style="display:block;opacity:1;background-color:Transparent; color:grey; border:none;">Appendix (<strong><em>red-shift, GTBP, and porridge</strong></em>)</button>

<div id="starsBreq2_spoiler1" style="display:none">

<p>Breq has basically pulled off graviational time dialation. This is thought to alter the wavelength of light, &quot;blue-shifting&quot; the visible spectrum. That&#39;s why the white star light falling on the EM wave telescope appeared blue/black to Avaya. Also, we can in-fact &quot;hear&quot; gravitational waves, though the reverse hasn&#39;t been possible till now.  </p>
<p>I&#39;m messing around with the details of Alpha Centauri. While the names of the stars are right, there&#39;s no evidence of them interacting as described. In fact there&#39;s evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Physicists have widely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem">researched</a> the  N-Body Problem (AKA the generalized three body problem, or GTBP) in the context of stellar masses. Some variant of this problem features in other hard sci-fi novels like Cixin Liu&#39;s Three Body Problem and Dragon&#39;s egg by Robert Forward. Both of these authors have strongly influenced my writing.  </p>
<p>And finally, it makes a huge difference whether one adds porridge to water or the other way around. It&#39;s gorgeous either way, but there&#39;s a difference. </p>

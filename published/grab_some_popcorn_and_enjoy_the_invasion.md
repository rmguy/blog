Lun heard a thump in the darkness.
_Lights_

'Lights, please', said a shaky voice. 
_What sort of an asshole *asks* for lights._

'Sorry to disturb you'.
_A polite home invasion. All civil like. How Cute._

'Oh.. "Sorry to relieve your bladder" might've been more apt. I'm still figuring this out, you see.'

She could feel the dampness in her thigh. Judging from the stench it most definitely wasn't a period. 
_Control yourself. You're in the people's army!_

Lun suddenly realized she couldn't move. 
_Can I talk?_
She coughed.
_Probably_

'I.. I can't move. Did you poison me?'  

'No, just paralyzed, I'm afraid. I was afraid.'

'Do you realize I'm an admiral?'  
She tried to flex her fingers. Nothing. 
_No pain. That's good._ 
'What have you done?'

'Nothing I can't undo. Please activate the lights.'

'You've already tripped the alarm. If I don't deactivate it in 10 minutes the military police will show up.'
_And see you pissing yourself._

'I'd love to meet more of you Firma. But I'm positive I didn't trip anything.'
_Meet more of me? Fuck, a pervert in the pod?_

'I'm sorry you have the wrong pod. Firma is two down. 우박 히틀러.'

'I'm sorry I don't understand. And why should I.. "hail hitler"?'

'I just tripped the alarm asshole.'

'It is best you reverse it.. for your own sake.. you see.. I really would prefer you to _see_.'

'Bich'
The lights came on, voice activated by her accentuated Korean. 

'Isn't that much better? Now do you see?'

Lun looked around. She was in her single room bunker. Empty. The bathroom was locked from the outside. 

'I'm in your head.'
_Well fuck, it was bound to happen sometime._
_No. Think. You're sane, you can't move, you have a voice you can't locate. Keep him talking._

'Am I going to wake up or meltdown?'

'I don't understand.. a joke?'

'I'm either asleep or completely off the rails right?'

'Ah, no, neither. You fear madness. I did too. I was afraid I'd root you into it. I'm glad you can still reason.' 

_Is this the devil?_
'Are you God?'

'I wish. God's gift, maybe'

_So the devil's asshole himself_

'The truth is.. I crash landed on your planet. I had to eject into your body. It's now my life support system.'

_I'm actually and finally fucking losing my head_

'You have two options: I can either leave you here paralyzed and find another host or we can co-habit. Once again, I do apologize; Terran atmosphere is hostile to our kind.'

_or 3: I blow my brains out and kill us both_

'I agree to co-habitation. Can I have my limbs back?'

'Excellent. But you are forgetting something. I'm in your head, Firma. And shooting yourself won't kill me.'

_Hands!_
Lun rolled in bed. Stood up. 

'Now I'll need you to self-augment your Oculus so you can perceive my dimension. It will lead to a sort of .."blindness" in one eye.'

'Ok first things first, I'm not "Firma". I'm Lun. And secondly, I am not performing eye surgery on myself.'
_Do I have a choice?_

'I assure you, it's safe. In fact, most Firma born blind aren't really _blind_. They can only perceive wavelengths from our dimension, which their brains can't process. But your brain can, because my brain can.'

The military police burst through Lun's door. 
The military police turned to pink mist. 
_or 4: Grab some popcorn and enjoy the invasion_

We are now back with Lun, in her pod, sometime after the "pink mist" massacre of the [first chapter](https://notwelcome.in/lun-i/). This is North Korea 10 years before [Bethod's attack](https://notwelcome.in/breqage/).

The world had gone soft. Maybe it was the slow dependence on processed foods. Or the long periods of peace. But somewhere along the way, her grandparents, her great grandparents, _someone_ in her lineage, had lost their ability to torch ectoplasm. Just the thought of it was making her sick.

She looked around, surveying the carnage. If she hadn't looked closely at the bodies till now it was only because she was distracted by the end of her species. Her eyes darted from shoulder to torso to arm to leg.. looking for a pattern, some MO, but she was struggling to spot one.

She'd seen kills. Saying she'd seen kills was like saying a squid'd seen oil spills. She _breathed_ them. The Marines, the Spetsnaz, the Yamam, she was a savant of the slaughterhouse.. but this, this was singular in its execution. If she didn't know better she'd say it was a decapitation strike. It had the look and feel of one, no survivors, no id, all the vics left in uniform, uniformly headless. The signature style of the ROKUT, a group of heartless bastards who'd do anything to get _a head_. Except the Republic of Korea's Unauthorized Terminators would _take_ heads as trophies, not pulverize them against the wall.

There was some brain near the door. A piece of it was moving, crawling away from a pool of pink around it. Probably an insect caught in the plasma. The bodies, those that were still bodies, were oozing blood from viscera like cranberry preserve. Bacterial colonies once held in check by intestinal lining were exposed to the recycled air in her pod, giving it the rich aroma of sourdough starter. She was almost hungry again.

Lun was not squeamish by any reasonable standard. Quite the opposite, she was a connoisseur of death. The problem was, her engineering temperament was overriding her military training. The lizard part of her brain was running like she'd just been handed an egg in a room full of egg-hunting vipers. Years of impulse conditioning were back-firing, leaving her crippled with self doubt.

_Reflexive Control_, the phrase jumped to her mind unbidden. The opening gambit of a venerated general. The surest way to predict the moves of a quicker opponent in hand to hand combat is to spread disinformation that triggers a reflex.

What disinformation was this thing feeding her, and why? Was it really as dangerous as it was projecting? Was It _in_ her reflexes, or just amplifying them? Why did her pod look like a wet dream?

She recounted the facts with this new perspective.

There were people all around, at least four whole bodies in an eight by eight pod. MPs. Soldiers. Friends.. would be stretching it; _Non-friends_ she could id via handgun choices. The K5 was probably Chung-He. Fang loved her Jerico. The Hecklers nearest the brain puddle looked like Humin's'.

But they were already dead, the lucky bitches. The corridor cams would've caught *something* before her pod slammed shut, if _she_ was lucky. Reinforcements would arrive in under fifteen minutes, officers from next door, in under five. But those were the boundry conditions of luck in the DPRK, where traitors were taken alive at all cost. A court marshal would be polite, a double tap to the skull, a courtesy.

The blood splattered walls had led her to a definitive conclusion: She needed to get people away from _It_. She almost struck a match for the smoke detector before realizing she didn't know where it was; these new ones were embedded in the walls. There was no guarantee it would trigger on a low flame, and she didn't want to waste the one opportunity she had to trigger an evac drill. If _It_ could paralyze her, _It_ could fence her in, and she was helpless fenced. She had better chances tricking _It_ into a ritualistic corpse burning, provided she didn't dry heave to death first.

Her head started to spin as she thought about her options, or a lack there of. A part of her just wanted to fall asleep. Her hips moved autonomously, pulling the rest of her in the general direction of the bed, but her legs gave out somewhere near the pile of human. She burrowed her head under an armpit as she lost consciousness, hoping they'd just stick her in the incinerator with the corpses.

<p>I&#39;ve realized it&#39;s a lot more satisfying doing something niche that I enjoy, than something mainstream that I enjoy less. Suffice it to say I had a lot of fun writing this chapter. </p>
<p>By the way &quot;The Harlequin&#39;s Carnival&quot; is a surreal painting by some famous dude. It looks like shit. I hope doing it at least left him craving sourdough and cranberry preserve. </p>

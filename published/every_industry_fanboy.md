Software is a nasty domain. Really nasty. On the surface it seems like a purely technical field, but there's an inherent tension between the need for algorithmic certainty and the fluidity of development done by humans. If you've ever created.. well, basically any software, this epiphanic progression probably feels familiar:
  
>    
1. software is terrible
2. people are terrible
3. there are too many different scenarios
3. nothing will really work for sure
4. itâ€™s provable that nothing will really work for sure
5. our lives are meaningless perturbations in a swirling vortex of chaos and entropy

This is an argument built on false premise. All software is _not_ terrible, you are paid to ship software that is. The leaders at the top shouldn't be ok with destructive teams existing, and the engineers shouldn't be ok with bad culture. None of us have a real say in the matter, but by god, it's still ok to call it out.

So far we have seen two instances of Contact with an extra terrestrial race.

* Lun, a North Korean Admiral, woke up to a voice in her head. 
* Riak, a psychotic social worker was killed by Haddie. 

Though we don't understand the nature of Lun's abductor we know Haddie is part of a transdimensional race called Scythes. All we know about Scythes can be summed up thus: they seem nice (but they also seem interested in human brains). There is at least one other Scythe that goes by the name of Cats. 

Oh, and Breq and Bethod - two beings from another galaxy - destroyed humanity twice over. But that doesn't happen for another ten years story time.

Avaya shuffled into her office thinking about what the day held in store for her. Her life as a postdoc had more or less come to a stand still. Here she was, an aspiring researcher in Experimental Cosmology, teaching a class on Classical Mechanics with zero publications in the last sixteen months. Cosmology was really not the type of field one could experiment with, seriously, it was just easier to accept that the universe split every time a cat couldn't decided if it wanted to live. And Classical Mechanics, well, Newton had that pretty much covered from day one.

The only hope of a passing break was to suck up to some tenured prof writing a paper on quantum something or the other. "Gluons" was a good word to get stuck to. She'd been working this angle for months and finally got herself some time with the Hadron Collider. Busy work. All she wanted was enough brownie points to get her hands on the LIGO telescope. 

It had taken her these couple of months to realize she was being played. She'd always thought of herself as the rising star, but the pattern was obvious now. Every tenured prof she got paired with was broke. And no funding meant no runtime on fancy equipment. And that, in turn, made her an armchair cosmologist.

She'd finally cracked the cycle when she met Mr.Gluon. That man could publish the drawing of a butt and people would line up three times to kiss the paper. Fifty, close to retirement, and severely over-funded with defense contracts, he wasn't too concerned about where she spent his credits. On paper, she was spending it crashing protons into each other, in reality, she spent it watching black holes collide. 

So now here she _really_ was, part of a grumpy cabal of quantum physicists trying to unsuccessfully mate 2 fundamental particles because they weren't satisfied with the Almighty's explanation. If she didn't produce a trial and inquiry into the origins of the universe soon, she'd have to make like an electron and transition states. From Hingoli to her sweet home in Kodaikanal, where the skies were so brown because they reflected the sludge her family dumped into toxic river springs. 

"என் தலை விதி", she muttered sotto voce, as she opened her email spam folder. She'd even co-opted the sysadmin to funnel the expense reports of her LIGO runs through the Collider's accounting group. Unfortunately, the kid was an ass hat who often forgot to set the subject line, sending the report straight to spam. She made a mental note to buy him a drink before bringing it up, he was probably doing it by hand. 

As she filtered through the subject-less emails in her spam she noticed that one of them didn't have any flags in the summary view. Flags indicated links or attachments. Almost all real spam had a link, and expense reports had an attached bill of usage. Curious and half dreading adult content, she opened the email from an hour ago. 

If anyone made a movie about her life till now, it would probably not include a disclaimer, but if it did, it would say: kids, don't open your spam.  

It was a curious email. It had a single line: "Hello Dr. Avaya."

Okay, she thought to herself, a Nigerian prince? or ass-hat playing tricks? 

"I'm very busy and don't have time for pranks. If you genuinely want to discuss something, sign up for office hours."

She hit send. In a few minutes, even before she'd clicked on the next mail, she got a reply. 

"Based on your response I must refine my initial greeting. At exactly 8 pm tonight I will sing for you. This is how I choose to introduce myself."

Bizarre, even by black hole standards. She puzzled over it for a few minutes before dismissing it altogether. For one, encouraging creeps was a universally bad idea, and for another, she already had a date with a Gravitational Interferometer at 8.

The email was swept out of her mind as she badged into the LIGO that night, replaced by thoughts of the galaxy cluster she'd been tracking for the last few weeks. As she focussed the telescope, her mind drifted to the last time she'd observed the birth of a pulsar. The gravitational waves coming out of it had registered a solid 10^-24, amongst the strongest observed, but some old fart in Sweden had already claimed the observation. These days, any of them would be lucky to get a strain reading higher than.. she checked the display on the Interferometer.. 10^-12.

She froze. 

10^-12 was almost a million times higher than anything anyone had ever seen. She ran to the space telescope, panting and struggling to focus it in time to catch the stellar event. It wasn't the highest resolution telescope, but gravitational waves of that strength had to be from a really powerful star explosion. She wanted to _see_ it, even if some _vathiyar_ in the Vatican took all the credit. 

An itch in the back of her head said something was wrong; an explosion that size should be observable with the naked eye. Not that she'd know where to look without the Interferometer, but the pazham kuttis at Caltech should've predicted it. There should be YouTube live streams of two black holes slow dancing to death by now. 

The space telescope showed nothing. Just the bald night sky. At first, she thought she was focussing it on the wrong horizon. She hadn't used one of these in years. She fiddled with the wavelength calibrator for a few minutes before deciding to re-check the LIGO reading, cursing her luck that the same telescope didn't detect both types of waves. 

It was back to ambient levels. Probably just disturbance from a party down at the Naganath temple. Had she imaged the spike? 

She went back to the space telescope to confirm. Sometimes it caught a delayed portrait so she'd set it to record at 1000 fps. Still nothing. 

And then the whole sky went black. 

For a moment, Avaya though she was having a black out, but the room stood still. Unsurprisingly, the sky came into sharp focus as she fit her eye back into the eyepiece.

Was she losing it? She decided to just take a minute and stare at the stars to compose herself. Counting the constellations had a calming effect on her. Sometimes she'd try to focus on Sagittarius-A. She used to catch most of Orion from her bedroom as a kid, but had to go up to the terrace to find Canis. 

And then, without warning, it happened again. One second, stars, the next, the entire sky went black. Except this time, she observed the transition. Stars, black, stars again. The night sky had just winked at her. 

She checked the time. It was 8:02 pm. 
She pulled out her handheld and found the subject-less email in her spam. 

"I really hope, for your own sake, that you haven't hacked the Interferometer". 

In a few minutes, she received a reply. 

"Hello again doctor. Do I have your attention now?"

<button onclick="starsAvaya_spOneOnClick()" id="starsAvaya_spoilerButtonOne" style="display:block;opacity:1;background-color:Transparent; color:grey; border:none;">Appendix (<strong><em>Two hard things</strong></em>)</button>

<div id="starsAvaya_spoiler1" style="display:none">

<p>A comment some engineer left in <strike>AWS Elasticache</strike> Netscape source code: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>// There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and 
naming things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Someone said in an interview that it was a code comment by Phil Karlton in Netscape. Shame that we can't confirm the Elasticache bit, given the reliability of that service)</p>
<p>Well I actually find nomenclature <em>harder</em> in a Sci-Fi story. At least I can give Sci-Fi names to my classes and functions.</p>
<p>Old habits die hard. </p>
<p>Some of my characters are named after characters in other stories. More 
precisely, I always seem to like side characters that die or stop showing up, 
and I want to resuscitate them through my writing (they're probably turning in their graves).</p>
<ul>
<li>Breq got her name from a psychologist friend who made me take the Behavioral 
Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire. I was going somewhere with this, I
swear.</li>
<li>Bethod: Villain in the First Law universe. I don&#39;t know if he actually shows up. People just keep talking about him.</li>
<li>Avaya: contortion of a real life name. </li>
<li>Cats: friends of Cat. </li>
<li>Haddie: Had-die.  </li>
<li>Lun: lun-i, lun-eye, loony.</li>
<li>Ignace Karkasy: OMG I TOTALLY NEED AN IGNACE KARKASY.</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as caching goes, I&#39;m going to start invalidating your memories by including summaries in the appendix. Plain vanilla narratives for people who can&#39;t tolerate mediocre writing. This chapter&#39;s summary is quite straight forward, tldr: Avaya is Lun&#39;s daughter. Wait, you didn&#39;t get that? :D</p>

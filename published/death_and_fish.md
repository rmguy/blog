"You lurk in the shadows watching your charge. Every dusk, every day break, you're with them like a leashed mutt. But they don't see you for what you are."

Muss put down the sharp-end scissors, "Do I have a schedule?"

"No, because you're not in charge. If you were you'd do it all the time. _Every_ dusk, _every_ day break, and and we'd have caught you by now." 

"So I stalk them?..", the Rib-Shears found their spot near the scissors.

"Yeah. Till something happens. A trigger. A moment of weakness. Then you extend a helping hand", Miller said, though even he had to admit that his stalker stabber theory was pretty farfetched. 

"A friend in need's a friend that bleeds", Muss chuckled at her own silly lay.

And that's exactly where the theory broke down. This was the third corpse of the week with a skull full of oxygen. No brains on the inside. No wounds on the outside.

"Maybe he's targetting airheads", Muss said, shrugging as she wiped her scalpel.

_Act 1, Scene 1: Death by Red Pill_

Haddie had been trying to learn funny lately. Cats said it was a vital part of "hobnobbery", so she was subtitling everything in her head. She didn't understand the difference between her-funny and them-funny yet, though she was sure it was of some consequence to him.  

_An old joke: Boy meets girl at mom's funeral. Boy likes girl. Girl leaves unexpectedly. Boy searches around for a few days, no luck._

How does this end?

_Them-funny: Boy kills dad hoping girl comes for the funeral. Big joke._ 

_Her-funny: Years go by. One day Boy wins lifetime supply of frozen dinner. Girl shows up to deliver, but she's carrying a single meal._
_Boy, confused, asks: where are the rest?.. I won a lifetime's supply._ 
_Girl replies: this will do, let's eat._ 
_Go figure._

Haddie snapped out of her reverie. 

They were in a brightly lit room. The man sitting across Drew had just introduced himself as Riak from the Death Wish Foundation, a non-profit committed to fulfilling the dying wishes of children with terminal conditions. He'd setup a camera to record the process. He'd said it was for impact evaluation, even though Drew hadn't asked. They were prattling on about something. 

"I love her, and my wish is to see her settled and happy..".    
Riak turned the camera off with a grimace.

_Video edited to cut out retching noises_

"Alright Drew. I hate to be the one that breaks it to you.. but this thing you call Love, this self-emptying of emotions, it's just another neurological disease", Riak shrugged with his hands, "in fact it's an indefensible one, unlike your present condition, because it's so under-researched."

"But my mom and dad loved each other", Drew said defensively. 

Riak's smile started and ended at the tips of his eyes, "And then you popped out! See! All we know about Love comes from field data, and all that shows are billions upon billions of the worst gene pairings conceivable. Irrationality, psychosis, mental retardation, suicidal ideations.. all traceable to within one friend request of True Love."

_Yeah Drew. How about we go to Universal Studios instead?
Subject: Haddie.
Death-Wish: fulfilled.
Details: Saw a Hippogriff, drank Butter Beer, died happy._

"Now tell me, would you prefer I take your fourth finger off today, or after you've put a ring on it?", another fake smile. All Riak's smiles looked the same, like he'd heard a good joke about a dead man at his funeral. 

Drew moved his head vertically up and down. Didn't that mean "today" in the present context? Haddie shrugged to herself, though no one was paying her any attention.

Nod or not, Riak wasn't a patient man. He jerked out a switchblade and slammed it down over the tip of Drew's ring finger. Haddie could see a tiny bone stump poking out now.

_Note to parallel-universe-mass-market-paperback-self: open with show-and-tell. Torture in the first act. It's a real crowd pleaser._ 

Drew started screaming and crying at the same time. Riak poured himself a glass of water as the crying cresendoed, then grabbed Drew's shirt and slapped him. A clean backhand converted to a full-blown punch on the reverse swing. For a kid Drew's age, to a jaw that size, the effects were devestating.  

"Child shut your mouth. Do you remember what we discussed?"

Drew nodded. 

Riak rewound the tape and flipped the recorder back on.

"What is your wish little one?"

Riak mouthed the words he needed from Drew off screen. 

"W.. World Peace" Drew said, through swollen and bloodied lips.

"That wasn't so hard now was it you little bastard", Riak said cutting the feed. He'd probably get a few grand in funding from this cute video alone. The problem was keeping Drew quite till he croaked, not a problem Riak wished to solve at leisure. 

As Riak pulled a pistol out and aimed it at Drew's head, Haddie stepped out of her shadowy corner; a dark form with white-lidded-hypnotic eyes. 

A Scythe intervening with happenings in the three dimensional world was rare. A Haddie intervening, even more so. But Haddie needed Drew's brains intact and this imbicile was going to blow them all across the shiny stainless.

_She brought her scythe down in a clean stroke of mercy, slashing the frenzied social worker from shoulder to navel._

A Haddie joke. Of course that's now how it happened. 

Haddie walked up behind Riak. In 4-space Riak's head looked more like a demicube than a sphere. She tore through a chunk of it with her scythe and yanked his brain out in-tact, dropping it into the support system she'd brought for Drew. Cats would just have to make do with an adult-psycho brain for now. 

As she left, she swiveled around and waved at Drew.

_We are simple creatures. All we want is death and fish._

<div id="daf_spoiler3" style="display:none">
<p>There are some challenges writing a higher dimensional being. Firstly, all of my three and a half readers aren&#39;t tripping on dmt. Thought experiments that fascinate me don&#39;t necessarily fascinate them (eg: twisted cross-dimensional romance) but idk, maybe I shouldn&#39;t assume: does it? (.. and when I say romance I really mean, er, how do they have sex?). </p>
<p>Alright I&#39;m joking. This might be a dingy bar on the internet, but it&#39;s a <em>politically correct</em> establishment. Politically speaking, anything&#39;s correct in the lawless chaos of the Universe. </p>
<p>Secondly, a lot of this writing is <em>because</em> I want to take some sharp left turns. I detested the Lovecraftian Elder Gods (higher dimension beings, gaze too long at them and you got nuts), but I don&#39;t love the straight science Einstein-ian fourth dimension either. Suffice it to say steering clear of N-space is a non-starter, but I don&#39;t have many examples to learn from. Navigating it will be easier if you accept &quot;..because..&quot; and &quot;magic!&quot; as  convincingly scientific explanations.</p>

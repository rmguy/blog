Korova is my version of a dingy bar in an obscure corner of the internet, replete with: 

* obnoxiously pretentious story-telling 
* slavish adherence to transhumanism
* rampant displays of bigotry
* healthy amounts of ridiculously overdone pseudoscience

Hell the only decent thing about it is that you are not welcome; unless you're here to give me money, which I will gladly accept:

Avoid real-life interaction as much as possible.

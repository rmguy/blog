So you have some bodies in a room and you're an alien. You're on a new planet.
You have no idea what kind of floura is around, the atmosphere is hostile and
you _need_ the neurochemical system of your native host. A host you've managed
to subdue in some dark corner of its own mind, after an hour of bickering with
your peering partners.

Now you're hungry.
What do you do?

Eat the bodies of course. If it works, that's one problem solved.

But this is a delicate situation, one that requires consideration. What if the
Rigi's were already here? What if these humans had been their hosts. What if
the bodies are imbued with their poison?

Depends on whether you think the Rigil's have near light speed travel yet.

...

Fuck it. You nibble at the tip of an extremity.

Yuck.

You measure your jaws up against its skull. You consider where your incisors
would end up if you fit your mouth around its ears, in true form. They'd end
up on the other side of its cranium. But you can't true form. Not yet. And
anyway, you need _its_ head because there aren't any other heads around.

You masticate the end of a severed neck.

No, no, no, you're not that desperate.

You chew off pieces of a locmoting appendage.

Rubber. A welcome change.

What now? true form? You'd die in seconds, but what about the stuff in its
cavities? You know it has cavities.

You settle for rubber.

...

Alright forget about your biology for a minute and think about theirs. What did
you come here to do? You'd almost forgotten the mission in your ravaging hunger.
The bio weapon. Implant a bio weapon.

Where? You'd already chosen. The eye.
Why the eye? because you're desperate. Maybe the others will choose
differently, but you know _eye_ better than anything else. You've already done
eye before, on yourself.

What do you need? A knife? no, not really, rewiring optic nerves is achievable
without a single incision. What else do you really need? painkillers? good
luck, there's some in the ship, but the ship's somewhere near the.. actually, the
ship's probably within reach if you have a moving human; a walking, navigating
human.

You have a decision to make. Move the human. Wake the human.

"Ok human", you say in what you think is a commanding tone for human.

I sing the sky. 

I climb up onto the plinth at the intersection of the telescope's arms, and 
start ululating nonsense into the night. 

"AAAAAAA; GAAGAGGGAGGAGAR".

It comes out my mouthpiece a throaty chirp. You'd know what that sounds like if 
you've ever heard a gravitational wave. 

On my home planet I don't listen to songs, songs listen to me. I use them to 
preserve our prisoners. 

No, not therapeutically, _literally_. 

Precise decibel levels at precisely the right angles, converted to gravitational 
waves, keep the erratic g-forces of a trinary star system from playing pool with 
the planets in between. 

Alpha Centauri is a triple star system. Rigil, Toiman and Proxima. They form a 
minacious love triangle with my planet and its moon at the center. Except the 
triangle is sometimes isoceles, sometimes scalene, and sometimes as perfectly 
symmetric as the kind of straight line my income followed when I went on Basic. 

At first, we tried praying. 
Then we tried our hand at math. 
Finally everyone gave up and just got the fuck up out of the descructive radius.
Everyone, that is, except the prisioners of war from the five colonies. The
prisioners were first sent to a penal colony on Proxima-A. Good seasons were
ones that didn't rain hellfire because the planet got too close to a star.
During one of those the penal colony reached capacity, so they started sending
prisioners to Pa's only moon. That's how I ended up on a lunar penal colony.

Well, guess who discovered how to aim precision g-waves at the stars? That's how
I ended up pardoned into the exoplanet discovery crops. 

I don't need precision to change the color of light, however, only proximity.
And just a whisper would've done fine. A demure "aaaaaaaa; gaagagggaggagar",
but there's too much ambient noise on this damn planet. There's a bevy of noisy 
fuckers guffawing somewhere. I consider sewing their lips shut. It felt nice to 
scream in the open for a change.. Maybe they'd feel the same way. 

My palm held vibrates. I check the message knowing where it's from. I type, 
"Hello again doctor, my name is Breq" and hit send.
 
I climb down from the plint and sit on a small hump of dead rubble, balancing the 
palm-held between my knees. While I wait for a reply, I treat myself to a bag of 
reserves. It tastes gorgeously grey and horrible. 

This place reeks of dead cows and bigotry. The nav says the observatory's in 
some place called Aundha Nagnath, a hovel in a deeply religious country called 
India. I understand some of that, but I understand dead cows and bigotry better.






There are some things precision is useful for, like actually moving the stars that 
emit the light so they don't burn the surface of a planet. That sort of stuff.
Not stretching wavelengths incident on the sky grabber. That's a basic flex.

Avaya took a big breath and shat bricks.

She was transfixed by the message she'd just received. Things had taken a very
drastic turn. She thought she was talking to a harmless admirer, someone with
a few tricks up his sleeve.

As creepy as that was, she was intrigued. She'd stayed up the whole night
thinking of possible explanations for his parlor trick, but she effectively
still only had one. And it wasn't the one in front of her. The one in front of
her was _five_ down the list, after "LSD" and "God".

She exhaled forcefully, re-reading the message.

"Oh suck my _dick_", she said sotto voce, as she realized that a tiny, nugatory
piece of her soul, just a tea-spoon-ful of god fearing jelly she'd somehow
ingested inbetween all those loaves of atheist bread, actually _wanted_ his
claim to be true.

She decided to cross check this creep on Google Scholar.

The main problem with BJ being a sci-fi nerd AND a cosmology major was his deep and
sincere belief that the universe was a video game designed by some first year
engineering students in a parallel universe.

was that he most definitely believe that aliens will make contact in under a few
hunderd years.

"Coffee?", Avaya messaged on Ursa's Minors, a group of cosmology majors who were
just like Avaya in their deep love for Ursula Guin novels.

"Anyone up for a peer review?", Avaya messaged on Ursa's Minors, a group
of cosmology majors who were just like Avaya in more than one regard. Just like
Avaya, the group shared a deep love for stars and sci-fi; That is to say:
together they formed a _stellar_ group of Ursula Guin fans. Just like Avaya,
they all had dreams of sky-rocketing to stardom one day; Which is to say: they
only ever published anything in their dreams. However _unlike_ Avaya, they'd all
almost clubbed a student; Which is to say: they'd all held office hours last
week. Office hourse during which they'd encountered a particular _unclubbable_
individual.

But say one thing about Ursa's Minors, say they were Alienists. Alienists who,
since the title was taken, all agreed that "Ursa's Minors" was a fitting
_constellation_ prize.

"OMG YES did you see it?", BJ, the RA for Lunar Ecosystems DM'd Avaya almost
instantly. He'd been staring at the "ceiling", thinking about the moon, looking
for signs of cosmic disturbance just a few hours earlier. Just like Avaya, he'd
spotted something extraordinary. Unlike Avaya, one one had sent him creepy
junk mail.

".. the star blanket?!", Avaya replied.

"Why are you saying that like it's part of the syllabus?" BJ said,
sending her a moon emoji. "THIS".

It as a picture of the moon.

Debatably more exciting than Tejas Dhaba's free butter chicken, which
everyone knew as the reference point for using all-caps.

"Beej, Listen.. ", she started typing, before she realized he was actually
sending a stream of identical moon images. With a spatially shifted moon
smiley accompanying each one.

"_Why_ Beej.. why are you like this?", she said instead, after she got
the seventh.

"Diff them", he said surreptitiously.

"Tejas in 5 and we can just talk?", Avaya said, barely able to contain
the excitement of her own space mystery.

spent such an absurd
amount of time staring at the ceilings of the universe, thinking of space puns.




She'd texted on a university group asking if
anyone else had been "buccaneering", uni slang for staring into
space, at 8pm the previous day, and received several replies almost
immediately.

Oh, the perils of these feminie wiles, she thought to herself, though
she was entirely certain half these people were just lusting after
a space mystery. It was

Half these people were
just lusting for a space mystery. She'd picked the first one she was sure wasn't part of this
elaborate prank, the only person she actually spoke to on a
regular basis these days, her first year lab partner BJ.

friends on campus.

"So you're telling me you didn't see all the stars just go out
at 8 tonight? and you're sure you were actually looking up the
sky grabber at that time?"

_five_ down the list, a list where the third and fourth were
"LSD" and "God".

She exhaled forcefully, re-reading the message.

"This is not a threat. I don't need to write you a story to
threaten you. It is a plea. A confession. And a maddening failure.

I sent you a message almost half a century ago. You are yet to decode
it. This is my fault. I failed to understand your sociology. Failed to
understand that you grew up in a world that takes gravity for granted.

'6equj5' was never meant to be a radio signal. The radio waves were
just ripples generated by modulating the gravity of your planet.

The message was in plain english, a language we picked up from your
Voyager craft. It was encoded in morse code, a technique we understood
you to use. But the carrier was a seismic P-wave that went unnoticed.

Hearing no response, observing no reaction, we decided to embark on
a journey. Unfortunately, so did several others."

"Oh suck my _dick_", she said, sotto voce.



 So when Ambal told BJ about the bone-white
face-painted-student's questions on G and the same bone-white-faced student had
come to BJ's office hours, he'd asked her a question of his own.

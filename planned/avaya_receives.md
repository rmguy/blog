Avaya took a big breath and shat bricks. 

She was transfixed by the message she'd just received. Things had taken a very 
drastic turn. She thought she was talking to a harmless admirer, someone with a

possible explanations for his parlor trick.

She re-read his message. 


She exhaled forcefully 

"Oh, suck my _dick_"

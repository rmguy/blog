"I apologize, this was what you'd call.. ah.. a prank?" 

"If this is your idea of a prank, I can't wait to see carnage."

_It's just like gardening. You're spraying insectiside. Sweeping motions over 
half-dead corpses of a MP squad._

"So how come you didn't attack us till now?"

She had come to accept the terms. There was no bargaining. It was going to be a 
master/slave relationship. 

"Attack? No, no, I'm here to warn you."

"Right, about the dead MPs in my pod. A little late for that isn't it?"

"No. About the zero point energy in the fifth dimension."

"Ah the pyramids of Ghaza. Anubis. I knew it."

"I don't understand"

"Sarcasm, sorry. Run that by me again? is this about my eye surgery?"

"Well yes, and no. 
There are _many_ fifth dimensions. In fact, there are 11. Humans have already 
named three x, y and z; very imaginative. We just called them 3, 8 and 9. 
Your eye is regarding dimension 4." 

"So what're the remaining 8?"

"Doesn't matter. The important part: dimension 5, _our_ dimension 3, is what

"And there's another thing that spills out tons of radiation, but they're not 
connected. The country you call the United States ..has been lying to you. The 
math is sound, but the physics and chemistry doesn't work."

"Ok genius, so how did all those people die on Hiroshima? You can't achieve
rapid spread without an explosion catalysing critical mass"

"Zero Point energy. There's a steady level of ubiquitous and ambient energy. 
It's _everywhere_, like the static on your TV screen. You an I call it different

They say drinking helps, but it doesn't. Sex helps, sometimes, unless it's 
with a talker. Working out too. Target practice, but only because it _feels_ 
useful; Take my word, it's not. Weed just makes you not so worried about 
feeling bad. 

These're all just tricks to forget. None of them _really_ help. 

It's not just the fear, it's all the other little bits you need to remember. And
there's no easy way to do that. You can try biting a fold of skin between your
fingers. If you're not that squeamish, you can try scissors and stitches.  
Ironically those help the most because they trigger the right chemicals. But you 
need to know when to stop. 

And stopping is a start. From there on you're on your own.

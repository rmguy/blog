The human stared at Presger as if to say "Fuck you looking at?".
In her arms were bloodied remains.
A piece of flesh stuck out of the side of her mouth.
Presger turned away from the mirror.

_Ok human_, Presger said in thought-speech.

The human's point of view was warped. Presger had long since overcome this
mental block against cannabilism. He was now using her inhibitions against her.

The human tried vomiting.

_Let's talk, while you still have your guts_, he said, watching her try to
punch her tonsils out.

The human convulsed in shock, eyes wide, pupils dialated. She was now gripping
her throat and forcing violent coughs.

_We don't have time, you need to listen_.

She grunted, then curled into a ball on the floor. Presger just stood her back
up.

_As you've no doubt realized, I can control your motor functions. Fully._

She froze like she'd been hit by a hammer. Presger waited, then shut down all
her limbic movements so she was back on the ground. The human was now back to
the state she had been when he'd first introduced himself. Paralyzed except for
her vocal cords, lips, mouth and eyes.

"So.. ", her voice was shaky. She hadn't mastered thought speech yet.
"So.. what was.. why.. What are.. ?"

_A centaurian called Presger. And you are?_

"Lun."

_Hello Lun. Let me formally introduce you to the situation you find yourself in.
You, a human of some questionable rank and origin in a nation that no other
country on your planet trusts, find yourself abducted by an alien. An alien that
has full control over you. An alien that can make you do.. basically anything.
Do you understand what I'm saying?_

Lun remained silent.

_Ok so like I was saying, you need to_ listen. _Listen, very very carefully to
what I'm about to say. And do_ exactly _what I ask of you._

The human had calmed down unexpectedly. Given her heart rate when she saw herself
in the mirror, Presger had thought it would take hours, but her brain waves indicated
a sophisticated level of cognition.

_First, I need to give you something. A weapon_

"Wha.. What?"

_It'd be best if you didn't interrupt, I can control your arms long enough to
carry out the requisite functions. I simply need sedatives from you. I'm sure
you have them_ somewhere _but it'd take me days to find them alone. I'm not
thrilled about feeling the pain for what we're about to do._

Luns brain function spiked at the mention of the eye surgery. That was good for Presger,
he needed her thinking at her cranial limit now.

"Under the bed. There's a pill box. Take the tiny round pill with an R on it. It
should make us numb for about two hours."

_There is something else you must know before we shoot ourselves with unprescribed
painkillers, and trust me, you_ want _to know this. Do not kill us. Believe it or not,
I am the last salvation of your species. Now I ask you again, where are the sedatives?_

Lun seemed to consider. Her brain waves were back to logical, but there was an edge to them,
like she'd been thinking suicidal maniac till now.

"We can trade."

_There's no time_

"You just said you needed me. And you're the last hope I have. So we need each other right?
Trade, or eat the pill", Lun said with a tone of illogical defiance.

_What're you terms?_

"I need to make a phone call. Take it or leave it. Don't interrupt. Don't ask questions",
Lun paused, "Don't forget, we don't have _time_".

She was smirking in her head.

Presger was actually proud he'd picked her.

_Ok, you have exactly two minutes at the end of which I paralyze_ everything, _including your
vocal cords, unless you tell me where the painkillers are._

"WAIT. Tell me what you're about to do? What is this weapon? I'd like to prepare myself"

_I'm about to re-wire your optic nerves so you can_ see _a different dimension. There's no
logical way to explain it given our current constraints. If you give me the wrong medicine,
you will die in a world of pain and I'll just re-host. Understood?_

"Yes", Lun said, pulling out a mobile phone.

...///

Lun disconnected within ninety seconds.

"There's a box with a cross, it should have a syringe and a vial labeled
landite. Pump the syringe half way, 300ml, overshoot and I'm dead."

_checkmate motherfucker_

Presger heard the thought but didn't care.

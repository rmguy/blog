"Ok you just took out an entire squad of MPs".

"It was ah.. what you'd call a prank"

"Oh good! Before we embark on our next mission I have a serious question.. 
every been to a bar?", Lun needed a distraction. 

"A bar? No. But you have memories of this thing. The first ones coming from a 
book called The Savage Detectives.. "

"Nevermind all that. It's just a _great_ place, to play pranks"

Lun had a dish to serve at this bar. A new recipie. 

* One gas grenade.
* One middle finger. 
* A handful of entitled COs. 
* A whole lot of liquid nitrogen. 

Contrary to popular belief, this was a dish best served _burnt_.

Lun jerked out of her lucid dream to skull shattering grunge rock. She crawled
out of bed cursing the katzenjammer elves, wondering what she'd brought home
home that smelled so putrid it was making her hurl on an empty stomach.  

_Fuck, No, that's the sound of a bolter saw hacking through a solid steel door
you dumb bitch._

Lun snapped up with a start and grabbed her service revolver. She'd just wasted 
precious seconds on nostalgia. She remembered falling asleep, remembered letting 
it take her, remembered why.. 

The bodies were still there. Blood oozing out of the viscera like cranberry 
preserve. Bacterial colonies once held in check by intestinal lining exposed to 
the recycled air in her pod, giving it the rich aroma of sourdough starter. She
was almost hungry again. 

.. But she remembered why she'd let her self sleep, and she pulled the trigger.

**T-30 minutes**

The world had gone soft. Maybe it was the slow dependence on processed foods.
Or the long periods of peace. But somewhere along the way, Lun's grandparents,
her great grandparents, _someone_ in her lineage, had lost their ability to
torch ectoplasm. She felt sick. Somewhere along the way, she'd got soft. 

"So let's work this out methodically chingu."

Lun's engineering temparament was overriding her military training. Reflexive
conditioning is only useful in situations similar to those used to prime said
reflexes, i.e situations someone expected her to face. An alien implant slaying 
MPs that broke down her door, completely novel, and completely novel is
engineering for quotidian. 

The cameras in the corridor would've captured the mist by now. Reinforcements 
would arrive in under fifteen minutes. Officers from next door, in under five. 

"Can you kill everyone on this base? 84 people?"

She had to call his bluff. 

"Simultaneously, I can pull off a couple of headwounds. Double that number and 
I can maim them. Triple it and I can make probably make them giggle long enough
to escape."

"_Escape?_"

"Why of course, now that you mention it, it almost sounds like you don't have a 
choice. We can _escape_ without killing the whole base if you give me eyes."

_There it is, the bluff._

"Fine. But I need to make a call. Don't ask questions, don't interrupt, we don't 
have time. The cameras in the corridor would've captured your bloody spindrift. 
Reinforcements will arrive in fifteen minutes. Officers from next door, in under
five."

Lun pulled out her mobile and dialed Wen. 

Wen didn't pick. It went straight to voicemail. She still remembered the siren
ringtone, no way Wen was ignoring it, she was either out cold or dead. 

"Hey Wen, remember that dead man's switch I gave you?"

Wen picked up. Her voice was raspy, breath coming in short gasps. 
Lun just continued

"Hey babe, _blast it out_. To everyone listening. Maximum power for as long as 
you. Do it if I don't call back in an hour. Love you."

That was her lifeline. It was the best she could do. Call an ex who sounded like
she was having a baby and leave a message with a deadline.

Lun disconnected.  
_Check, motherfucker_

There was a faint buzzing from outside her door, Lun recognized it as the sound
of several adjacent pod doors opening simultaneously. The buzzing stopped and a 
gravely voice came through the air gaps, "Admiral.. What's going on?".

Lun acted on instinct. "I'm holding.." She checked a badge " MP Fang Diyon 
hostage."

"Alright chingu, you have me for fifteen minutes. Improvise. Stall everyone at
the door with hostage negotiation. If you still can't see when the
reinforcements arrive we're both dead."

Lun dropped into a hazy dream.

**T-20 minutes**

Wen picked up as soon as she heard Lun's voice but froze in place when she heard
the message. 

"Lun.. I woke up blind.. ", she stuttered. She wanted to say something about the
stars in the sky instead. Something cheesy. Something she knew Lun would've 
giggled at ten years ago. But that's what came out, and Lun had already hung up.
Fuck it. 
3599. 3598. 3597. 
She could throw the dead man's switch in her sleep.

**T+60 minutes+360 days**

The pointman on the X60 inter-stellar explorer had just received the one message 
all fifteen ships in the fleet had dreaded ever since they'd left earth five 
years ago. A simple 3 line message, decoded simultaneously over radio and gamma. 

"Earth has come into contact with a warfaring civilization. Treat any further
contact from the planet as a ruse. By the time you hear this you may be the only 
surviving humans in the universe. Act accordingly."

The source was signed and verified as DPRK military head commander Wen Wen 
Fuang.

_It's just like gardening. Spraying insectiside. Sweeping motions over half-dead 
corpses._

"Ok you just took out an entire squad of MPs".

"It was ah.. what you'd call a prank"

"Oh good! Before we embark on our next mission I have a serious question.. 
every been to a bar?", Lun needed a distractin. 

"A bar? No. But you have memories of that thing. The first ones coming from a 
book called The Savage Detectives. They had something called.. "

"Nevermind all that. It's just a _great_ place, to play pranks"

Lun had a dish to serve. A new recipie. 

One gas grenade.

One middle finger. 

A handful of entitled COs. 

And a whole lot of flames. 

Revenge is a dish best served burnt.

She was rudely awakened from her woolgathering by the sound of a bolter saw 
hacking through a solid steel door. 

"Shit! Ok the tactical force is here. I'd say we have about ten minutes till 
they take the bunker. Any undisclosed powers that can help us escape?"

"Simultaneously, I could pull off a couple of headwounds. Double that number and 
I can maim them. Triple it and I can make probably make them giggle."

"_Escape?_" 

"Why of course, now that you mention it, it almost sounds like you don't have a 
choice."

"Well, there's no chance in hell we're escaping unless you can take out this
whole fucking base. 84 people. Think you can handle that chinga?"

"Not running blind, no. But I could dodge the six MPs outside your door, and the
handful of officers from down the corridor. I could get us to the armory if I 
had one eye"

"No. Not eye surgery. It's out of the question."

"You're making it sound like I killed those officers to coerce you. Like I
planned this. I would never"

"Fuck you"

The buzzing stopped and a gravely voice came through the air gaps. "Admiral..
What's going on?"

Lun acted on instinct. "I'm holding.." She checked a badge " MP Fang Diyon hostage."

"What're you doing?"

"Buying us time"

"Admiral, you of all people should know how this is going to end"

"I want to talk to Col Sgt Deek Jun. Just him. Just for ten minutes. And then
I'll turn myself in and no one gets hurt"

Deek Jun was in the adjacent base a few kilometers out. This would buy her at
least twenty minutes.

"So let's work this out methodically chingu."

Lun's engineering training was overriding her military temparament. Reflexive
training is only useful in situations similar to those used to condition said
reflexes, i.e situations someone expected her to face in the line of duty. An
alien implant slaying MPs that broke down her door, not one of them. The cameras

"Can you kill everyone on this base? 84 people?"

Fun didn't pick. It went straight to voicemail. She still remembered the siren
ringtone her son had for her, no way he was ignoring it, he was either out cold
or dead. 

"Hey Funner-son, remember that dead man's switch I gave you? broadcast it to
anyone who's listening. Maximum power for as long as you can over gamma or
radio. Do it if I don't call back in an hour flat. Love you."

That was her lifeline. It was the best she could do. Call a son that wouldn't
pick and leave a message with a deadline.

Bevelled, blonde and bewitching, the box just sat there protesting its freedom.
It wore that damaged product look like it had just been refurbished at a
radioshack, pride leaking out of its plugs and sockets. The sticker on it read
"Free Microwaves", as though you could just stick a hand in there, catch some
and be off. The gills on its side had spots of rust, the numbers in its display
were either zeroes or eights, and if you saw it, you'd want to put some food in
it. It qualified as a handsomley dishevelled hobo by most standards.

You'd never have guessed that it was new.

New as in "abondoned-by-the-side-of-the-road" New. New as in "today was the
first day anyone peed on it" New. New as in "never used", not "never abused".

They could've stuck "fireball" on it, or "prometheus".. now there's a name to
make a box hum. Even a simple "flammy" would've dignified its existence.
Anything to make the coming onslaught bearable; instead they'd labeled it
with a trite epithet. Like anyone would take it for a money safe, or a
television set, or the most lethal non-violent weapon known to man. Indeed
starting fires was its self-designated role in society, not cooking ramen. It
had always wanted to go out in a blaze of glory. It was this ambition that made
its abandonment so abominable.

Like most alleway gimcracks, the box soon fell victim to an interspecies
devaluation racket. It must be pointed that while there were two parties in this
racket, it was perpetuated by man and man alone. For while all the people
walking past thought "eww that smells like piss", the dogs thought "hey that's
mine". Unlike most cycles of domestic abuse, however, this one was broken when
two kids walking past thought to ask a question.

"Who abandons a _microwave_?", said Fuang.
"..and aren't all _micro-waves_ free anyway?", said her sister, Lun.

The box almost shorted its circuits trying to respond. It was lonely. It wanted
not to be New anymore. But its opinions on the matter were inconsequential (and
for the record, _most_ microwaves _are_ free. The wavelengths that aren't are
reserved for the people that are).

At first, it looked like the girls were also going to leave it behind. They
sized it up, debated, tossed a coin and slapped each others hands before finally
picking a side each and hefting it home. Leaving it on the grass in their
backyard, they rushed in and emerged with a bucket and a power cord. The daring
pyrocube sat waiting patiently as the stockier of the pair, the first one,
filled the bucket up with water from a hose. Then the taller girl plugged it
into a socket in the ground and they both giggled. The box hummed to life.

Boy were they easily thrilled. All it did was sit and hum its daily hum, the one
tune it knew, and they danced around it clapping. It's lights flickered, its
dials shivered, but they didn't seem to care. Who would give a couple of kids
access to a _free microwave_? Not their mother, that's for sure. And so the
merrymaking began.

The first experiment was a slice of bread. The box had no idea what to expect,
it was New, so it did its best. The bread turned to toast. The toast turned to
burnt toast. In under five minutes, the bread was a pile of ash.

Then the children replaced the bread with a stuffed toy. The box had some idea
what to expect. You would too, if you'd created ash with your bare bands. It
tried its best at first, concentrating on the fleshy bits first, but this was
much harder. The children grew tired after ten minutes and took the toy out.

Third on the list was a plastic bag, tied around the mouth, encasing a slice
of pizza. The box felt like it would get this one, it felt just like bread all
over, but it was also cautious of its previous failure. It burst to full power
as soon as it was turned on, expecting a tougher fight, but the bag caught fire
almost immediately. In under a two minutes.

Rather than running to fetch water, the children cackled with the glee of an
experiment coming to fruition. Not wanting to throw water on the firestarter,
they extricated the burning bag with a stick and buried it in the sand.

And then they did the most heartless thing, they smahed the box's front panel.
The box watched as one of them stuck their hands through its broken pane and the
other turned it on. The box wished it had eyelids to shut, but it obeyed. It
tried to look away from _her_ eyes, but this was impossible as her eyes were
shoved up against its display. It couldn't even decide if this was bread,
plastic or toy.

One girl squealed. The other immediately turned the switch off. The first girl
pulled her hand out with a big smile. It had been in for just a few seconds, and
it was unscathed. The box hummed a sigh of relief.

It was the second girl's turn now, the one that had operated the switch, but she
was running back into the house. She emerged carrying another, much smaller box.
For the first time in its newly used life, the box noticed another box humming.
This hum was much louder. More sonorous. It had a repetitive nature that seemed
melliflous.

"Hello, Fuang residence, this is Lun", the girl said into the box.
Then she looked at it puzzled.
Then she stuck it into the free microwave.
The first girl turned it on.

In under a second, the box knew it had just killed for the first time.

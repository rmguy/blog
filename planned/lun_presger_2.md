So you have some bodies in a room and you're an alien. You're on a new planet.
You have no idea what kind of floura is around, the atmosphere is hostile and
you _need_ the neurochemical system of your native host. A host you've managed
to subdue in some dark corner of its own mind, after an hour of bickering with
your peering partners.

Now you're hungry.
What do you do?
You nibble at the tip of an extremity, of course.

If it doesn't kill you, you know two things. Firstly, that humans aren't
poisonous, and secondly, that humans taste like..

You can't tell what they taste like from that nibble..

You measure your jaws up against its skull. You consider where your incisors
would end up if you fit your mouth around its ears, in true form. They'd end
up on the other side of its cranium. But you can't true form. Not yet. And
anyway, you need _Its_ head because there aren't any other heads around.

You masticate the end of another's severed neck. As you chomp on the flesh, you
realize an error in your logic. If you _do_ get poisoned, it might just mean the
Rigils have arrived. Poisoning hosts would be their idea of a practical joke.

You chew off pieces of a locmoting appendage.

Rubber. A welcome change.

What now? true form? You'd die in seconds, but what about the stuff in its
cavities? You know it has cavities.

You settle for rubber.

...

Alright forget about your biology for a minute and think about theirs. What did
you come here to do? You'd almost forgotten the mission in all this ravaging.
The weapon. Implant the bio weapon.

Where? You'd already chosen. The eye.
Why the eye? because you're desperate. Maybe the others will choose
differently, but you know _eye_ better than anything else. You've already done
eye before, on yourself.

What do you need? A knife? no, not really, rewiring optic nerves is achievable
without a single incision. What else do you really need? painkillers? good
luck, there's some in the ship, but the ship's somewhere near the.. actually, the
ship's probably within reach if you have a moving human; a walking, navigating
human.

You have a decision to make. Move the human. Wake the human.

Ok human

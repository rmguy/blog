Bevelled, blonde and bewitching, the box just sat there protesting its freedom.
It wore that damaged product look like it had just been refurbished at a
radioshack, pride leaking out of its plugs and pockets. The sticker on it read
"Free Microwaves", as though you could just stick a hand in there, catch some
and be off. The gills on its side had spots of rust, the numbers in its display
were either zeroes or eights, and if you saw it, you'd want to  give it some
food. By some metrics, it qualified as a handsomley dishevelled hobo.

You'd never have guessed that it was new.

New as in abondoned-by-the-side-of-the-road New. New as in today was the first
day anyone peed on it New. New as in never used, not never abused.

They could've stuck "fireball" on it, or "prometheus".. now there's a name to
make a box hum. Even a simple "flammy" would've dignified its existence.
Anything to make the coming onslaught bearable; instead they'd labeled it
with a honorific. Like anyone would take it for a money safe, or a television
set, or the most lethal non-violent weapon known to man. Indeed starting fires
was its self-designated role in society, not cooking ramen. It had always wanted
to go out in a blaze of glory.

While the dogs walkig past had thought "hey that's mine", and everyone else
walking past had thought "eww, that smells like dog piss", the two girls walking
past this daring little pyrocube had thought "and aren't all microwaves free
anyway?". The box had almost shorted its circuits trying to respond. It was
lonely. It wanted not to be new anymore, but its opinion on the matter was
inconsequential (for the record, _most_ microwaves are free, but some bands
are reserved for _free people_).

At first, it looked like they too were going to leave it. They'd sized it up,
debated, tossed a coin and slapped each others hands before finally picking a
side each and hefting it home. Leaving it on the grass in the backyard, they'd
rushed in to fetch a power cord. The shorter one plugged it in while the
stockier of the pair prepared a bucket of water. Smart kids. Then they'd
both giggled as the box hummed to life.

Boy were they easily thrilled. All it did was sit and hum its daily hum, the one
tune it knew, and they danced around it clapping. It's lights flickered, its
dials shivered, but they didn't seem to care. Who would give a couple of kids
access to a _free microwave_? Not their mother, that's for sure. And so the
merrymaking began.

The first experiment was a slice of bread. The box had no idea what to expect,
it was New, so it did its best. The bread turned to toast. The toast turned to
burnt toast. In under five minutes, the bread was a pile of ash.

Then the children replaced the bread with a stuffed toy. The box had some idea
what to expect. You would too, if you'd created ash with your bare bands. It
tried its best at first, concentrating on the fleshy bits first, but this was
much harder. The children grew tired after ten minutes and took the toy out.

Third on the list was a plastic bag, tied around the mouth, encasing a slice
of pizza. The box felt like it would get this one, it felt just like bread all
over, but it was also cautious of its previous failure. It burst to full power
as soon as it was turned on, expecting a tougher fight, but the bag caught fire
almost immediately. In under a two minutes.

Rather than running to fetch water, the children cackled with the glee of an
experiment coming to fruition. Not wanting to throw water on the firestarter,
they extricated the burning bag with a stick and buried it in the sand.

And then they did the most heartless thing, they smahed the box's front panel.
The box watched as one of them stuck their hands through its broken pane and the
other turned it on. The box wished it had eyelids to shut, but it obeyed. It
tried to look away from _her_ eyes, but this was impossible as her eyes were
shoved up against its display. It couldn't even decide if this was bread,
plastic or toy.

One girl squealed. The other immediately turned the switch off. The first girl
pulled her hand out with a big smile. It had been in for just a few seconds, and
it was unscathed. The box hummed a sigh of relief.

It was the second girl's turn now, the one that had operated the switch, but she
was running back into the house. She emerged carrying another, much smaller box.
For the first time in its newly used life, the box noticed another box humming.
This hum was much louder. More sonorous. It had a repetitive nature that seemed
melliflous.

"Hello, Fuang residence, this is Lun", the girl said into the box.
Then she looked at it puzzled.
Then she stuck it into the free microwave.
The first girl turned it on.

In under a second, the box knew it had just killed for the first time.

I wrote a [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-3FjrS7CErAwDewqG9NuVKyf-4hmkZpH/view?usp=drivesdk) during my Phd. Several actually. It only took a few months. They remain white. That means unpublished, basically. It means I wrote an exposÃ© and the editors thought it was a joke. Rarely is "white" used in a negative connotation. Hurrah academia. 

I didn't write the papers I wanted to write when I started. That's a longer story. But I did write the papers I could. Here is an abstract 

> This paper offers an explanation for the rapid expansion of US foreign markets immediately following the cold war. Using recently declassified CIA documents, we show a strong correlation between US political intervention and a surge in American imports. We present evidence that foreign governments started purchasing US products in spite of increased trade costs, concentrating capital flow into the US and away from other exporters. Our explanation for these observations is that the US had significant influence over trade policy drafted by political regimes installed or supported by the CIA. 

We. I. Me, and my ambivalence. 
We're taught to write papers in 3 parts: Why, What, How. Sometimes I don't have objective answers for these questions.

My posts are usually about crypto and computers. You might think this is cutting edge, others might think this is trivial, but to me this is just "turf". My part of the neighborhood. Inherited turf; but turf nonetheless. Defensible property. Alienable possessions. Sketchy equations. Whichever. Which even if I get wrong, the rest of the world won't. It's their job. Mine too, but I don't give a damn about your secrets and your passwords anymore. 

So this paper is different. It goes further back. Has more originality. More rigor. Less Math. More lies. And either I got it wrong, or most of the world is deceived. 

Maybe "deceived" is the wrong word. I would like to be ignorant. Then I won't know how ignorant I am. Or maybe I _am_ ignorant and I don't know how foolish I sound. Eitherways, I would like to be without shame. I'm ashamed of myself for not trying sometimes. So I'll try. 

That is the Why.

You can read the paper for the What and the How, I told the editors, that's your job. Maybe I should've used a highlighter. 

The What is easy: Universal access to drinking water. Primary education. Family planning. Women's rights. Undermined class interests. Democracy. 

The flattening of slanty lines. 

We learnt about those in economics. You can't draw a straight line through points on a plane. Not if those points represent humans. You can draw a bell. Or a circle enclosing them. Or a bushy one - two diverging lines on either side of the cluster. But you can't straighten any of these shapes. Econometricians have a word for this, "heteroskedasticity". 

Most of econometrics is someone loading a machine gun up with Greek symbols and firing them at a piece of paper. One of these symbols is epsilon, the error term. It accounts for everything the armchair assassin couldn't care less about. One off anomalies that won't generalize into a theory. Cyclones. Wars. Famines. Military coups. 

This brings us to the How. How do we straighten a bushy line? Through economic growth. A rising tide. That's the answer I'd like to give you. I'm too tired for the other one.
